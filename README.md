## Architecture

![Architecture](./doc/architecture.png)

-   Store delivery list on S3
    -   To prevent exceeding the capacity limit of the queue.
    -   To serve as a record for auditing
-   Lambda as the worker to call notification services

    -   How to prevent a 15-minute timeout when Lambda has not finished sending messages?
    -   Based on testing, Lambda sent out 4,500 emails within 10 minutes. Therefore, before the Sender sends delivery list to the queue, it will be divided into batches of 5,000 recipients per batch.
    -   Test Record

        |         | send 10 emails with for-loop |
        | ------- | ---------------------------- |
        | 1st     | 1737.02 ms                   |
        | 2nd     | 1.655s                       |
        | 3rd     | 956.673ms                    |
        | 4th     | 1.300s                       |
        | 5th     | 1.152s                       |
        | average | 1.356s                       |
